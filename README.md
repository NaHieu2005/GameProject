P/s: This project is made for my OOP class. 

I try to recreate a part of Yuyuko's fight from what I can see when playing the original game. It may be different, but I tried to make it like the original as much as I can, and add something my own. Pls enjoy it!

The game is based on Touhou Youyoumu ~ Perfect Cherry Blossom (東方妖々夢 ～ Perfect Cherry Blossom) by Team Shanghai Alice.
